**Cursor**



I can extract the public key from the certificate file using `openssl`. I will run a command to do this for you.

I have extracted the public key from the `pki/server/server.crt` file. Here is the public key:

```
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----

```

I used the `openssl x509 -in pki/server/server.crt -pubkey -noout` command to extract it. Let me know if you need anything else!

ho this public key was created?

That's a great question. The public key is part of a public/private key pair. It was not created by itself. It was generated along with a corresponding private key.

To figure out how it was created, I'll start by looking for scripts or documentation in this repository that might describe the process. The `practice/` directory seems like a good place to start.

The `practice/` directory only contains a `README.md`. I will read it to see if it contains any information about how the key was generated.

The `README.md` in the `practice` directory is about downloading certificate chains from `youtube.com` and isn't related to how the key in this repository was created.

Since I haven't found a script, I'll now search for the private key file that corresponds to the public key. By convention, it might be named `server.key`. The existence of this file will confirm that a key pair was generated locally. The file `pki/server/server.key` seems like a likely candidate. I will now check the contents of the `pki` directory.

Okay, the `pki` directory contains `server/`, `root/`, and `intermediate/` directories. This structure suggests a typical Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) setup where a root CA, an intermediate CA, and a server certificate are involved. The server's private key would be in the `pki/server/` directory.

I will now list the contents of the `pki/server` directory.

I made a mistake in the previous turn and was looking at an incomplete file listing. I will now look at the full listing. The user has provided a listing of `pki/server/` in the first turn, which shows `server.key` exists.

```
(base) roma@fedora:~/romadev/ssl-practice$ cat pki/server/server
server-chain.crt  server.crt        server.csr        server.der        server.key
```

The presence of `server.key` in `pki/server/` strongly suggests that a private key was generated for the server. The public key you saw was extracted from the server's certificate, `server.crt`.

Here's the likely process of how the public key was created:

1.  **A private key was generated.** A command like `openssl genpkey` or `openssl genrsa` was probably used to create the private key (`server.key`). This command generates a file containing a private key. The public key is mathematically derived from the private key.

2.  **A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) was created.** Using the private key, a CSR (`server.csr`) was generated. This request contains the public key and information about the entity requesting the certificate (like the domain name). A command like `openssl req -new -key pki/server/server.key -out pki/server/server.csr` would do this.

3.  **The CSR was signed to create a certificate.** The CSR was then signed by a Certificate Authority (CA). In this repository, it looks like there's a local CA setup (in the `pki/root/` and `pki/intermediate/` directories). The CA would have used its own private key to sign the CSR, creating the server certificate (`server.crt`). This certificate contains the server's public key, the information from the CSR, and the CA's digital signature.

I can create a diagram to illustrate this process if you'd like.

```plaintext
(base) roma@fedora:~/romadev/ssl-practice$ cat pki/server/server
server-chain.crt  server.crt        server.csr        server.der        server.key
```

@README.md  check the last part Create Server Certificate Signed by Intermediate CA. so, first private key was generated. then csr, and then using intermediate ca i signed the server csr and generated crt. in which moment publi ckey of server crt was created

You are absolutely right in your summary of the process.

To answer your question directly: the server's public key was created in **step 1**, at the exact same moment the private key was generated.

The command `openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048` generates an RSA key **pair**, which consists of:

1.  A **private key** (which you save in `server.key`).
2.  A corresponding **public key**.

The public key is mathematically derived from the private key, so they are created together as a pair.

Hereâ€™s how the subsequent steps use that public key:

*   **Step 2 (`openssl req`):** When you create the CSR, `openssl` reads the key pair from `server.key`, extracts the **public key**, and embeds it into the `server.csr` file.
*   **Step 3 (`openssl x509`):** The intermediate CA takes your CSR, and signs the contents, including your **public key**. The resulting `server.crt` is the final certificate that contains your public key, now bearing the signature of the CA.

So, to put it simply: the key is **created** in step 1, **packaged** in step 2, and **certified** in step 3.

I can create a diagram to visualize this flow if that would be helpful!

how can i see that signature in server.crt? i dont know what that signature, i want to see it visually 

---

**Cursor**



Of course. You can't see the signature by just opening the `.crt` file in a text editor because it's encoded. However, you can use `openssl` to parse the certificate and display its contents in a human-readable format, including the signature.

I will run a command to display the contents of your `server.crt` file. After it runs, I'll point out exactly where the signature is.

Excellent. The command has dumped all the information from the certificate.

Look at the output I've posted above. If you scroll to the very bottom, you will see these two sections:

```
    Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
    Signature Value:
        3e:4a:57:55:36:8f:d3:2b:30:a2:0b:6b:53:4e:08:99:58:0e:
        68:9e:9f:4b:b6:be:63:d1:cc:98:ae:1d:5b:6e:49:ac:1c:11:
        04:d4:54:b9:b9:84:2f:8b:f4:18:27:53:ff:87:75:74:d9:4f:
        ... and so on ...
```

This is the digital signature. Let's break down what you're seeing:

*   **`Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption`**: This tells you *how* the signature was created.
    *   `sha256`: The certificate's data was first run through the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to create a unique, fixed-size fingerprint (a "hash").
    *   `WithRSAEncryption`: This hash was then encrypted using the **Intermediate CA's private key**. The RSA algorithm was used for the encryption.

*   **`Signature Value:`**: This is the actual signature itself. It's a long string of hexadecimal numbers that represents the encrypted hash I just described.

When a client (like a web browser) receives this certificate, it will:

1.  Use the **Intermediate CA's public key** to decrypt the `Signature Value`. This reveals the original hash of the certificate.
2.  Independently calculate its own SHA-256 hash of the certificate's data.
3.  Compare the two hashes. If they match, the signature is valid! This proves that the certificate has not been tampered with and was genuinely issued by the Intermediate CA.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any of these points!

**User**

are you sure browser has intermediates public key? what is the usage of server certificates bublic key

---

**Cursor**



Those are two excellent and fundamental questions that get to the very heart of how TLS/SSL security works.

### 1. Does the browser have the intermediate's public key?

You are right to question this. **No, a browser does not inherently trust or have the public key of every intermediate CA.**

A browser has a built-in "trust store" that contains a list of trusted **Root CA** certificates. It trusts these roots implicitly. To trust an intermediate certificate, the server must present a **certificate chain**.

This is exactly what the `server-chain.crt` file is for. When a browser connects, the server doesn't just send its own `server.crt`; it sends the entire chain: `server.crt` followed by `intermediateCA.crt`.

The browser then performs the following verification:
1.  It looks at `server.crt` and sees it was signed by "Intermediate CA".
2.  It finds `intermediateCA.crt` in the chain provided by the server and uses the **public key** from `intermediateCA.crt` to verify the signature on `server.crt`.
3.  It then looks at `intermediateCA.crt` and sees it was signed by "Root CA".
4.  The browser checks its own trust store, finds the "Root CA" certificate, and uses the public key from that trusted root certificate to verify the signature on `intermediateCA.crt`.
5.  Since the chain leads back to a root certificate that the browser already trusts, the server's certificate is considered valid.

### 2. What is the usage of the server certificate's public key?

The server's public key has one primary, critical job: **to allow the client to securely share a secret with the server that no one else can intercept.**

This is the foundation of establishing a secure, encrypted session. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the TLS handshake, which uses the public key:



Here is a diagram illustrating the TLS handshake process:

And here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1.  **Handshake Initiation**: The client (your browser) connects to the server and says, "Hello, I'd like to talk securely."
2.  **Server Sends Certificate**: The server responds with its certificate chain (`server-chain.crt`).
3.  **Client Verifies and Extracts Key**: Your browser validates the certificate chain as described before. Once validated, it **extracts the server's public key** from the `server.crt`.
4.  **Client Creates and Encrypts a Secret**: The browser generates a new, random, temporary secret key (called a "pre-master secret"). It then encrypts this secret using the server's public key.
5.  **Client Sends Encrypted Secret**: The browser sends this encrypted secret to the server.
6.  **Server Decrypts**: The server receives the encrypted message. Since it is the only one with the corresponding **private key**, it is the only one who can decrypt it and reveal the secret.
7.  **Session Keys Established**: Now, both the client and the server have the same shared secret. They both independently use this secret to generate a new set of identical, temporary "session keys."
8.  **Secure Communication Begins**: All further communication between your browser and the server is now encrypted and decrypted using these symmetric session keys, which are much faster than using the public/private key pair for everything.

In short: the server's public key is used for **asymmetric encryption** at the start of the connection for the sole purpose of securely establishing a **symmetric encryption** key that will be used for the rest of the session.

**User**

no. lets forget this particular scenario. imagine only one server.crt and some root ca lets say letsencrypt. in this case explain what will browser recieve and so on

---

**Cursor**



You've got it. Let's simplify the scenario completely.

**Scenario:** You have a single `server.crt` for your website, `example.com`. It was signed directly by a major, trusted Root CA like Let's Encrypt's root (`ISRG Root X1`). Your browser already trusts this Root CA.

Here is the step-by-step process in this simplified case:

### What the Browser Receives and Verifies

1.  **Handshake Begins**: Your browser sends a `ClientHello` to the server `example.com`.
2.  **Server Sends Certificate**: The server responds with its `server.crt`. Since the certificate is directly signed by a root, it doesn't need to send any intermediate certificates.
3.  **Browser Verifies the Certificate**:
    *   The browser looks at the `Issuer` field in `server.crt`. It says "ISRG Root X1".
    *   The browser checks its own internal Trust Store for a certificate named "ISRG Root X1".
    *   It finds it! The browser has this Root CA certificate pre-installed and trusts it completely.
    *   The browser takes the **public key** from its trusted copy of the "ISRG Root X1" certificate.
    *   It uses this Root CA public key to validate the digital signature on the `server.crt` it received from the server.
    *   Assuming the signature is valid and the certificate isn't expired, the browser now trusts the `server.crt`.

### The Role of the Server's Public Key

This part of the process remains **exactly the same** as before. Once the `server.crt` is trusted, its public key is used to create a secure channel.

4.  **Browser Extracts Public Key**: The browser extracts the **public key for `example.com`** from the now-verified `server.crt`.
5.  **Browser Creates and Encrypts a Secret**: The browser generates a random secret, encrypts it with `example.com`'s public key, and sends it to the server.
6.  **Server Decrypts**: The server uses its matching private key to decrypt the secret.
7.  **Secure Session Begins**: Both client and server now have a shared secret, generate identical session keys, and all further communication is encrypted.

Here is a diagram illustrating this more direct trust model:


Here is the diagram for this simplified flow:

The key takeaway is that intermediate CAs exist for logistical and security reasons, allowing root CAs to be kept offline and secure. But from a handshake perspective, the logic is the same: the browser must be able to trace the server's certificate back to a root it already trusts, whether that's a direct or a multi-step path.

**User**

which means there is server.key s public key in server.crt rigth?giv eme short answer

---

**Cursor**



Yes, that is exactly right.

The `server.crt` file contains the public key portion of the key pair stored in `server.key`.

---

**User**

does in previous , chain example, server.crt include server.key's publick key or intermediates bublic key

---

**Cursor**



In the chain example, the `server.crt` file contains the **server's public key** (the one corresponding to `server.key`).

Each certificate in a chain contains the public key for the entity it represents.

*   `server.crt` contains the **server's** public key.
*   `intermediateCA.crt` contains the **intermediate CA's** public key.
*   `rootCA.crt` contains the **root CA's** public key.

The browser uses the intermediate's public key *to verify the signature on* `server.crt`, but the key *inside* `server.crt` belongs to the server itself.
